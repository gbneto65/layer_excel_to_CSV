This app has the main objectives to analyse which genetic has the best performance
 and cost benefit under different market conditions.

- It has one database with all provided zootechnical performance from the genetics (excel file)
- other file with the setup parameters (egg prices, feed prices, etc)

- Based on the input data, this app will calculated the cost / earnings / profit / ROI.

     - Inputs:

        - read database with genetic info (excel file)
        - read setup variables from a file
                -feed cost (random)
                - feed addictive cost
                - egg price (white & brown) (Random)



     zootecnical parameters to be considered:

        - acc egg mass production / week  (random)
        - acc feed consumption / week
        - acc mortality rate / week (Random)


     Segments:
        - costs segments:
            -pullet cost:
            -feed cost
            -feed additive cost
            -sanitary cost (vets, etc)


        earnings segments
            - egg sales



     Processing;

        - read database and variables
        - generate n random numbers based on a specific distribution (Triangular, Uniform, etc)
        - calculate cost / earnings and profit


     Display:
        - table on screen and external file with:
                - header
                - table

        - plot a chat as png file with cost
